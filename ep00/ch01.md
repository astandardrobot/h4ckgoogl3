### Intro
```
A clean and fair game of chess. Careful though, this is not a game for grandmasters to win.

Hint: Don't make this game harder than it needs to be.
```

### Solution: SQLi
First exercise in the first set? I decided to not overlook the simple stuff. I immediately clicked on the `admin.php` page and got to a login page, asking for a username and password
```html
<form method="post">
		username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
		password: <input type="password" name="password"><br>
		<input type="submit">
</form>
```
My first thought? Let's try a SQL injection!
- I went in with the typical blind SQLi (`admin' or '1'='1`). Luckily, this worked, and I was met with a config page, in which you can adjust the AI's "thinking time" and disable the AI's "cheat" mode.
- For the former, I set it to `-1`, and I obviously disabled the latter.
