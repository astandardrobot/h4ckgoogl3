### Solution: Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Upon inspecting the sources, we find this key script data:
```js
      function search() {
        const file = document.getElementById("files").value;
        const term = document.getElementById("searchterm").value;
        const url = document.location.origin + "?file=" + escape(file) +"&term=" + escape(term);

        if (term.length < 4) {
          alert("Search term must be at least 4 characters long!");
          return;
        }

```
